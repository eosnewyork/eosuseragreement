## CHAIN ID: aca376f206b8fc25a6ed44dbdc66547c36c6c33e3a119ffbeaef943642f0e906

### Foreword

This document was written by EOS New York for the benefit of the community and is a result of our participation in the community-driven development of EOS governance over the past year. In order to be more sensitive to the many different ways the word "constitution" can be perceived across cultures and languages we have shifted the title of this document to the EOS User Agreement (EOS-UA). This document is an open-source template and EOS New York will not directly submit it for referendum. It is up to the community to decide if they believe this Agreement is a good foundation on which to build the ways we make collective decisions and direct the growth of the EOS Mainnet. In short, you should feel empowered to take this document and change it, amend it, propose it, or otherwise mold it to fit what you believe is best.

The design principles for this document:

* Absolutely no items that are unenforceable.
* Establishes a framework of "governing documents" so that amendment of the EOS governance can be agile across multiple documents rather than consolidated into one.
* Defines roles and responsibilities of various user types.
* Establishes the foundation of a dispute resolution framework and empowers individuals to self govern disputes as much as possible.


### Article I - User Agreement Ratification

This user agreement is considered ratified and approved for purposes of governing EOS blockchain {{chain_id}} when:

* at least 15% of issued tokens are participating,
* with at least 10% more Yes than No votes,
* sustained for at least 30 continuous days within a 120 day period.

### Article II - Distributed Jurisdiction

The EOS blockchain {{chain_id}} is immutable and all records and actions are recorded forever. EOS blockchain {{chain_id}} exists in a distributed and decentralized jurisdiction and is to be governed by and construed under the rules contained herein, this duly ratified agreement.

### Article III - Users

A user is any person or organization of persons who maintain(s) direct or indirect ownership of an EOS account and any property connected to that EOS account as defined in Article XIX.

### Article IV - User Agreement Mandatory Consent

By claiming direct or indirect ownership of an EOS account or property connected to an EOS account on EOS blockchain {{chain_id}} Users consent to these terms, definitions, and agreed upon standards with full consideration between all Users. {{chain_id}} string is included in the signature of every transaction validated and included in a block and appended to the Blockchain.

### Article V - Additional Registered Consent 

* Users who sign regproducer agree to, and are bound by, the regproducer Ricardian contract.
* Users who sign regarb agree to, and are bound by, the regarb Ricardian contract.
* Users who sign regforum agree to, and are bound by, the regforum Ricardian contract.

### Article VI - Amending Governing Documents

The EOS User Agreement, regproducer, regarb, regforum, are considered governing documents and are to be modified only by User referendum.

### Article VII - On-Chain

On-chain, as herein defined, means any transaction, smart contract, or Ricardian contract which is located within a block that has been deemed irreversible and appended to the EOS blockchain {{chain_id}}.

### Article VIII - User Referendum

User referendum is the sole mechanism for altering governing documents and/or effecting network funds. User referendums must be submitted on-chain either in full text or as a hash of the referendum text. A User referendum is considered approved for execution when:

* at least 15% of issued tokens have registered a vote for the associated referendum,
* with at least 10% more ‘affirmative’ than ‘negative’ staked EOS tokens (i.e. 55% yes, 45% no)
* sustained for at least 30 continuous days within a 120 day period.

Should a User referendum not be approved for execution within the 120-day period, it is considered expired and must be resubmitted if another vote is desired. The 120-day period starts when the transaction which includes the referendum question is appended to the Blockchain. EOS tokens issued during the 120-period are counted toward the total issued amount calculation.

### Article IX - Native Unit Of Value

The native unit of value on the EOS blockchain {{chain_id}} shall be the EOS token as defined and created by the eosio.token smart contract.

### Article X - Maintenance Responsibilities

Elected Block Producers who have signed the regproducer Ricardian contract should maintain the active Blockchain codebase. Further, they shall participate in the testing, review, and implementation to all modifications of existing features, all optimizations, and all upgrades.

Any attempt to alter any governing document, as well as any action that may alter the current state of any tokens considered "network funds" is prohibited without prior authorization obtained through a User Referendum conducted in accordance with Article VIII.

All other stipulations, requirements, demands, and standards for all Block Producers who agree to regproducer shall be delineated in the regproducer agreement.

### Article XI - Network Funds

Network Fund accounts are accounts that hold property which is subject to distributed ownership amongst the Users, and has no single User owner. Altering any pre-existing code that directly governs the allocation, fulfillment, or distribution of any network funds also requires User referendum.
Network fund accounts are as follows: eosio.names, eosio.ramfee, eosio.saving

### Article XII - Recognizing The New York Convention

The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958, shall be recognized by all Users of this Blockchain {{chain_id}} where the author of any such arbitral award is duly registered on-chain {{chain_id}} via regarb Ricardian.

###  Article XIII — Binding Of Valid Arbitration

Any on-chain provision included in any on-chain transaction, smart contract, or Ricardian contract, involving any type of EOS based property that results in controversy between parties to such a provision, or the refusal by any party to such a provision to perform the whole or any part thereof, or any controversy arising out of any other type of on-chain agreement between parties, shall be settled by arbitration.

If such a provision names or appoints an arbitrator or arbitrators registered through regforum Ricardian contract or regarb Ricardian contract, such method shall be followed. The application of either party to the controversy to the duly named {{regforum}} or {{regarb}} in such an on-chain provision is valid and enforceable, and {{regforum}} or {{regarb}} will act to resolve the controversy with full binding force and effect. Where agreed upon, users will submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of an on-chain transaction, smart contract, or Ricardian contract and will be administered by an arbitrator or arbitrators registered through regforum Ricardian contract or regarb Ricardian contract.

### Article XIV - Establishes the only circumstances under which accounts or contracts may be modified by Block Producers on behalf of the user.

Block Producers may never affect EOS User accounts where the owners of said account have not explicitly requested and prescribed the exact actions requested and have proven their ownership, or their authority, by way of a valid arbitral award authored by a duly registered arbitrator on-chain via regarb, to Block Producers. Block Producers may charge a fee for this service which is to be deposited into the eosio.vpay network fund to be distributed across all paid nodes.

### Article XV - No Fiduciary

No User shall have a fiduciary responsibility to support the value of the EOS token. No User can authorize anyone to hold assets, borrow, speak, nor contract on behalf of EOS token holders or the Blockchain {{chain_ID}} collectively. This Blockchain shall have no owners, managers, or fiduciaries.

### Article XVI - User Account Security Responsibilities

All items pertaining to personal account security, including but not limited to the safekeeping of private keys, is solely the responsibility of the User to secure.

### Article XVII - Freedom Of Association And Contract

The EOS User Agreement grants freedom of contract based on agreement and free choice to all Users. No part of this Agreement shall impair, interfere, or infringe upon the mutually agreed upon contracts between Users.

### Article XVIII - Inflation

Inflation is set at 1% per annum which is to be allocated to Block Producers for services provided to the EOS blockchain {{chain_id}}.

### Article XIX - EOS Property

Any object on-chain {{chain_id}} that requires a private key in order to directly manipulate, alter, transfer, influence, or otherwise effect it is considered property of the associated EOS account.
